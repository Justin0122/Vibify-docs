Each value has a range that it can be set to. Here are the values you can use for the targetValues:

- acousticness (0.0 to 1.0) - how acoustic the song is
- danceability (0.0 to 1.0) - how suitable the song is for dancing
- energy (0.0 to 1.0) - how energetic the song is
- instrumentalness (0.0 to 1.0) - how instrumental the song is
- liveness (0.0 to 1.0) - how lively the song is
- loudness (-60.0 to 0.0) - how loud the song is
- speechiness (0.0 to 1.0) - how much speech is in the song
- valence (0.0 to 1.0) - how positive the song is
- tempo - the tempo of the song
- key (0 to 11) - the key of the song (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on)
- mode (0 or 1) - the modality of the song (0 = minor, 1 = major)
- time_signature (0 to 11) - the time signature of the song
