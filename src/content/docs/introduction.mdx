# Introduction

Vibify is a project born out of a personal need. I found myself constantly liking songs on Spotify but never organizing them into playlists. This led to a staggering collection of over 7500 liked songs, and the number was only increasing (funnily enough, even more so now that Vibify exists). Frustrated by the chaos, I decided to take matters into my own hands and develop a solution. As Vibify evolved, so did my vision. Inspired by the possibilities, I continued to expand its functionalities, adding new features to enhance the user experience and unlock even more potential. The result is a powerful tool that can help users manage their music collection and discover new songs based on their existing tastes.

## Purpose

The purpose of Vibify is to help users like me who have a large collection of liked songs on Spotify but struggle to organize them into playlists. Vibify aims to automate this process, making it easier to manage and enjoy your music.

## Target Audience

Vibify is intended for Spotify users who have a large collection of liked songs and want an easier way to organize them into playlists. It is also for users who want to discover new music based on their existing collection.
