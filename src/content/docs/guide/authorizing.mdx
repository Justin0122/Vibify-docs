Authorizing with Vibify. You can use the `authorize` method to get the authorization URL for the user to authorize your application.

```js
async function authorize(userId) {
    return await vibify.authorize(userId);
}

const link = authorize('user-id');
console.log("URL: ", link);
```
Or with cURL:
```bash
curl https://localhost:3000l/authorize/user-id
```

<Aside type="note">
    When going to the URL, the user will be asked to log in and authorize your application. After the user has
    authorized your application, they will be redirected to the redirect URL you specified in the `.env` file of the
    server. In this case it will return the API key as a json response.

### Response

<div data-pagefind-ignore>
    <Response data-pagefind-ignore/>
</div>

### Response after clicking the link

```json
{
  "api_token":"7d5649cd1bd7253ddbd15e098459f15ba04..."
}
```
<Aside type="note">
    The API token is used for future requests using cURL. Disregard the API token if you are using the SDK.
</Aside>

### Scopes

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has. In this case, the SDK already has the necessary scopes for what it's capable of doing.

<Aside type="note">
    The user will be asked to authorize the scopes you specify in the `scopes` parameter of the `authorize` method.
