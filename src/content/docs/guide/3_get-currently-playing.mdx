To display the currently playing song, you can use the `getCurrentlyPlaying` method. This method returns the currently playing track for the user.

```js
async function getCurrentlyPlaying(userId) {
    try {
        const track = await vibify.getCurrentlyPlaying(userId);
        console.log('Currently Playing:', track);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

getCurrentlyPlaying('user-id');
```
