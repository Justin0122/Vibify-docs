To display the currently playing song, you can use the `getCurrentlyPlaying` method. This method returns the currently playing track for the user.

```js
async function getCurrentlyPlaying(userId) {
    try {
        const track = await vibify.getCurrentlyPlaying(userId);
        console.log('Currently Playing:', track);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

getCurrentlyPlaying('user-id');
```

Or with cURL:
```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: (your api key)" http://localhost:3000/currently-playing/user-id
```
