This method allows you to create a playlist from your liked songs from a specific period (`month` and `year`).

<Aside type="note" header="Note">
    This method may use *a lot* of API requests, depending on how many liked songs a user has. It's recommended to use this method sparingly.

    Consider liking my post on the Spotify Community to let Spotify know that there is a better way to retrieve liked songs based on when they were liked.

```js
async function createPlaylist(userid, month, year){
    const playlistName = `Liked Songs from ${new Date(year, month - 1, 1).toLocaleString('en-US', { month: 'short' })} ${year}.`;
    // (Liked songs from Feb 2024.)
    try{
        const playlist = await vibify.createPlaylist(userid, playlistName, month, year);
        console.log('Playlist:', playlist);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

createPlaylist('user-id', 1, 2024);
```
The `playlistName` is optional and will default to `Liked Songs from {month} {year}`, as shown in the example above.
