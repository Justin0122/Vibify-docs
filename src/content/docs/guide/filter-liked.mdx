import { Aside, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import Response from '../../../pages/responses/recommendations.mdx';


```js
async function filterLikedTracks(userid, filter, playlistName){
    try{
        const filteredPlaylist = await vibify.filterLikedTracks(userid, filter, playlistName); //playlist name is optional
        console.log('Filtered Playlist:', filteredPlaylist);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}

filterLikedTracks('user-id', ["artists:bbno$", "artists:yung gravy"]);
```

Or with cURL:
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: (your api key)" -d "{\"id\":\"user-id\", \"filter\":[\"artists:bbno$\", \"artists:yung gravy\"], \"playlistName\":\"optional playlist name\"}" "http://localhost:3000/filter-liked-tracks"
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
    This will immediately return a response. It will add the filtered liked tracks to a new playlist in the background, as it can take a while to complete (depending on the number of liked tracks).
    The tracks will be added in real time as they are filtered.
